# Hexagons_Rebooted
Rebooted as its the same idea as a previous repository (Hexagons) but started again after learnign that the original was all wrong.

The core of the Hexagon drawing function is derived (and a lot of the code is the still the same but re-worked) from the fantastic work of ZackTheHuman https://gist.github.com/zackthehuman/1867663

A Demo page (of the work in progress) is here http://jdrayson.co.uk/game/

Dwarves:
* have a maximum range of 3 hexes from their start point
* have a movment of 5
* get their allowences refreshed each turn

Movement cost of terrain is:
* Grass: 1
* Forest: 2
* Swamp: 3
* Mountain: 5
* Water: 8 (thus impossible for dwaves to move across)
